# Pi-Star-4.1.x-Plus
An augmented version of Pi-Star 4.1.x that tracks with the original. 

The file(s) included in this repository are provided as a means to seemlessly switch from the native Pi-Star respositories to equivalent (parellel, forked) repositories that include new and extended features.  The intent is to provide incremental improvements and developments in Pi-Star while allowing one to revert to the original (current) Pi-Star with minimum effort and no disruptions.

****  Still under construction ****

More to come later.
